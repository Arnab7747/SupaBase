# 🎉 Supabase Events Platform

A minimal **Next.js + Supabase** demo app where users can view upcoming events and RSVP (`Yes / No / Maybe`).  
Deployed easily on **Vercel** and powered by **Supabase PostgreSQL**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📅 **List Events**: Browse all upcoming events (from Supabase `events` table).
- 🙋 **RSVP**: Respond to an event (`Yes`, `No`, `Maybe`).
- 🔄 **Live Database**: All reads/writes happen directly against Supabase.
- 🖥 **Minimal UI**: TailwindCSS styling + navigation bar.
- 🌐 **Deploy Ready**: Works out-of-the-box on Vercel.
